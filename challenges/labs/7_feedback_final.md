# Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
Really useful and challenging. The way of doing where we're obliged to go on our own was really appreciated.
I would have been even more satisfied if my lab submissions were evaluated during the week, anyway I understand it is mnot feasable with so many guys.

# Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
AWS and Hue HA was new to me. Kerberos and Sentry were the most familiar due to multiple deployment already conducted. I am pleased to understand that my past work was not so bad.

# Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
Cloudera Manager how-tos was probably the most useful to refresh something I was no more studying since a long time. I think Sentry could be analyzed in much more detail because it's really relevant to most of my customers.

# How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
I am already actively installing Hadoop clusters for both POC and Prod. This week was really useful to strengh my knowledge of the Cloudera environment.

Many thanks to both instructors.
